# Misc MaxMSP Patches
## Vincent Giles, 2016

These patches are built in Max 7, and are for various performative setups that I have used/would like to use in future. Feel free to use 'em, branch 'em, etc. 

#### NanoKontroller.maxpat

This patch is a performance system for expressive and gestural control using a Korg NanoKontrol2.

#### Flute_fun.maxpat

Designed for flutist [Alice Bennett] (http://www.alicebennett.net), and hopefully with contributions from her. This patch uses incoming spectral analysis from a flute signal to control various parameters and create an intuitive real-time sampling improvisational system.

#### Virtual_Tape (dir)

This was an attempt at creating a pseudo-tape system with eight reels. I could not resist a small amount of digital convenience in the form of selectable segments of the chosen waveforms. The top four 'reels' are the sources, the bottom four are linked for recording from the top four.
